      <img src="profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      My name is Rhea and my greatest accomplishment is being a mother of 4 beautiful kids. Madison is 15,
          Noah is
          12,
          Logan is 10, and Kendall is 8. I am married to my best friend Ed, who I met in college. I grew up as
          a navy
          brat, so I lived in many different places. I was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, and moved to Honolulu,
          Hawaii.
          After Hawaii, I lived in Seattle, Washington and then Port Hueneme, California. Then in the 7th
          grade, I
          moved
          to Orlando, Florida where I went to high school and college. I moved to California to attend Loma
          Linda
          University and have been here since. By trade, I am a cytotechnologist. What is that you ask? Well,
          cyto is
          the
          study of cells. So, I microscopically look at cells, looking for abnormalities, specifically cancer
          cells.
          Due
          to my field fading, I have decided to take on a new career path, and that is why I am in this class.

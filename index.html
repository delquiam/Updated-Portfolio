        My name is Rhea and I am a Full Stack Web Developer with extensive years
        of experience as a Cytotechnologist and a life-long dedication to
        learning. I am looking to leverage my background in science to create
        programs that would help healthcare professionals do their jobs more
        efficiently. I would like to work in an entrepreneurial and dynamic
        environment with a chance to make an impact. I am effective at combining
        creativity and problem solving to develop user-friendly applications. I
        enjoy working the front-end, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have
        also done work in the back-end, working with NodeJS, Express, MYSQL,
        MongoDB, and React.
